/**
 * The basic interface to foundation http clients.
 * This interface allows you to choose between the following options:
 * <br/>1. execute a request directly using executeDirect - assumes a fully constructed url
 * <br/>2. execute a request with LoadBalancer using executeWithLoadBalancer - assumes a partially constructed uri
 * <br/>3. execute a request directly or with load balancing using execute - decision is based on the 'enableLoadBalancing' flag in the Httpclient factories.
 *
 * This class uses Generics to bind to specific HttpRequest and HttpResponse types. The actual binding is done via the Client factory implementations.
 * Refer to wiki to see possible configurations for clients.
